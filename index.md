## About Me
Hi my name is Justin and I'm from Walworth, NY. For high school I attended Wayne Central where I participated in both track and soccer. I'm heavily invested in athletics while also a software developer. For track I got 8 school records at my high school as well as competed and medaled at states 3 times. I've been programming for about 8 years now and was self taught and got some help from my Dad while learning who is also a programmer.
